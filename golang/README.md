# What's this?
Alright, this is a great ongoing journey of learning a lot of stuff around Golang.  
I started learning Golang by watching Todd Mcleod's videos then summarizing each section.  
I update the repo with stuff I learn in the journey.  


## TODO
This is the list of remained sections, questions, books to read, and some other things.  
Hope I could finish them someday.

- questions
	- When do we have to use closure?
	- When do we should limit visibility?
	- When do we use package scope variables?
	- Everything is passed by value even functions. How does a function get stored inside the memory? Is it in the Heap?
	- How is a function copied as a param? (pass by value)
	- How to determine the size of a function or a variable or a struct?
	- How is a Type passed? Are Types passed by reference? Where the codes are stored? In the Heap?
	- Are function's args stored in the Stack section of the memory?
	- If you initiate two instances of a struct, does the code get duplicated in the memory?
	- What is cgo (c inside Golang?)?
	- What's the performance cost of adding elements to a slice because of doubling the inner array size?
	- Is each rune taking 32 bits? (1-4 UTF8)
	- How does a struct get stored inside the memory? What about other data structures?
	- How does comparison work in Golang? Something like `__equal__` and `is` in Python or `equal()` in Java?
	- Where do structs `blueprints` get stored in the runtime?
	- Does the function of a struct get stored inside the memory?
	- Why do we can call anything with `.` on `&Type` in Golang?
	- How to attach methods to Types?
	- Why there is no difference between `&person{"James", 20}` and `person{"James", 20}`?
	- How many cores does Golang use by default?
	- How does garbage collection work in Golang?
	- Where do we use Golang generics?
	- Where do we use Channels and Goroutines?
	- If a variable gets created inside a function and the function gets terminated and a pointer is returned, do you still have access to the pointer content? (c++ question for Golang)
	- delete an elem from slice - effect on `len` and `cap` - delete inner elements
	- What are composite types?
	- shorthand declaration vs var
	- make vs new
	- `int*` vs `*int` vs `* int` vs `int *`
	- `type a struct{ b int, c string}` vs `type a struct{c string, b int}
	- backtick vs double quotes
	- marshaling vs encoding
	- unmarshaling vs decoding
	- effect of different return types in interfaces (signatures)
	- memory allocation in C++ vs Golang
	- stdout vs stderr from the view of file descriptors
	- struct{name Person name}
