# What's this?
Alright, this is a great ongoing journy of learning a lot of stuff aroung Golang.  
I started learning Golang by watching Todd Mcloud videos then summerising each section.  
I update repo with stuff I learn in the journey.  


## TODO
This is the list of remained unread sections, question, books to read, and some other things.  
Hope I could finish them someday.

		- interfaces
		- promotion or overriding
		- encapsulation
		- states = fields = data
		- behaviours = methods
		- instantiation
