Tell me lies, like how you're better off without me
While the truth is written all over your face
Even in photographs together you look lonely, lonely
When you were here, you never had to fake
And girl I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know
Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?
And the way that you can say you don't remember
How I kept you coming over every night
And the way that you can say you never wondered, wondered
If loving someone else is just a lie
Woah, girl I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone (you hang up the phone)
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know
Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different? (different)
Does it feel (does it feel, does it feel, does it feel) feel like you never gon' find nothing better? (gon' find nothing better)
Does it feel (does it feel, does it feel, does it feel) feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different? ('cause I loved you different)
And girl, I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know
Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different? ('cause I loved you different)
Does it feel (does it feel, does it feel, does it feel) feel like you never gon' find nothing better? (gon' find nothing better)
Does it feel (does it feel, does it feel, does it feel) feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different? ('cause I loved you different)



phase 5

Now is the winter of our discontent,
Made glorious summer by this sun of York.
