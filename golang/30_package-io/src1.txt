// TeeReader returns a Reader that writes to w what it reads from r.                                                    
// All reads from r performed through it are matched with                                                               
// corresponding writes to w. There is no internal buffering -                                                          
// the write must complete before the read completes.                                                                   
// Any error encountered while writing is reported as a read error.
